If you attempt to wear armor you are NOT proficient in, you still get the listed AC, but...

"you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or Attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast Spells."

Proficiency in armor allows you to wear that armor type without penalty. If you are wearing armor that you are not proficient in, you have disadvantage on any attack roll, ability check or saving throw that uses strength or dex. You also cannot cast any spells in armor you are not proficient in.
